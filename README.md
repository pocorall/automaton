# A DFA library that is fast and easy to use

With pocorall.automaton, you can do:
* search multiple strings super fast (see [benchmark](http://tusker.org/regex/regex_benchmark.html))

pocorall.automaton is forked from [dk.brics.automaton](http://www.brics.dk/automaton) library. We extended the original code as following ways:

* [Allows state object](#state-object)
* [Downloadable from maven repository](#maven-artifact)
* Hosted on github :-D
